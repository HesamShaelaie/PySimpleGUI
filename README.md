# Assignment

For this assignment, we need to use the information coming from Lab 3. We want to design an interface for the user to search, add, and get a query from the database without writing any code. For this purpose

1. Design a window for books to
   * Takes a book name as input from the user and searches the database to check if the book exists in the database or not
        * If the book does not exist in the database then it shows a message indicates the library does not have the book
        * If the library has the book but it is not available, then you need to show the information of the person who borrowed the book
   * If it is not available, then provide three input fields asking for name, email and expected return date. Also, you need to add a button to save this information and update the database

2. Design a window to get a report on genres
   * Put the name of all genres in a listbox in a window
   * In the same window, the user should be able to select multiple values
   * You need to check if the number of the selected items is greater than two in order to make a result button available
   * By clicking on the result button, a new window should appear with a pie chart that shows the ratio of the selected item

3. Design a window to take the information of a new book and add it to both databases


<span style="color: green"> Being creative in designing the windows and using different elements in your solution will bring you extra points. </span>
