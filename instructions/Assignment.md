# Assignment

For this assignment, we need to use the information coming from Lab 3. We want to design an interface for the user to search, add, and get a query from the database without writing any code. For this purpose

1. Design a window for books
   * That gets a name of a book and shows if it is available or not. 
   * If the book is not available, then you need to show the information of the person who borrowed the book
   * If it is available, then provide two input fields asking if you want to put a name and expected return date. Also, you need to add a button to save this information.

2. Design a window to get a report
   * you need to find all the genres in the database
   * put the name of all genres in a listbox in a window
   * in the same window, the user should be able to select multiple values
   * you need to check if the number of the selected item is greater than two in order to make a result button available
   * by clicking on the result button, a new window should appear with a pie chart that shows the ratio of the selected item

3. Design a window to take the information of a new book and add it to both databases

Being creative in designing the windows and using different elements in your solution will bring you extra points.
